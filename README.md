# Spline Approximation & Revit Point Extraction

This project contains tools for:

- Approximating 2D and 3D splines using Python.
- Extracting evenly spaced `(x, y, z)` coordinates from spline curves in Autodesk Revit using the Revit API.
- Exporting spline data to `.txt` files for further analysis or visualization.
